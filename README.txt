Solar System Voyager (SSVG)

SSVG is simulation software which enables users to fly their own spaceprobes in the solar system.  Each spaceprobe has three propulsion systems: a chemical propulsion engine, an electric propulsion engine, and solar sail.  Fly your own spaceprobe in the precisely simulated Solar System.
