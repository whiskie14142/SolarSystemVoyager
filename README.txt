Solar System Voyager (SSVG)

SSVG is a simulation software which allows users to fly own spaceprobe in the solar system.  Each spaceprobe has three propulsion systems: a chemical propulsion engine, an electric propulsion engine, and solar sail.  Fly your own spaceprobe in the precisely simulated Solar System.
